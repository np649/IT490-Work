https://github.com/dbivin/IT490/projects/1    

Obstacles: 
Had problems initially setting up the db and getting the app to be able to successfully login and connect to it. Ended up having to just add a user and give it the correct credentials and permissions. Also had problems with getting the DB to correctly receive the information it needed from the API.

Learnings/experience:
	-Learned much more about using Git and Github since I only had minimal experience working with it in the past. Now have a full understanding of how it works and how github can be used to coordinate for projects.
	-Learned what rabbitMQ is and how a messenger service works, since I had never worked with in one in the past
	- Was already knowledgeable of SQL but had learned more about setting it up from scratch on a Linux based machine.
	-Learned a lot more about how much time and work goes into making a project. It definitely takes time even just setting up everything so that everyone can do their part and it's clear what needs to be done. So now I know for future projects to make sure a lot of time is spent just planning everything out early on.
	- Learned how to use Amazon AWS to create VMs and connect to them.

Obstacles:
- Had an issue with Github on my VM when cloning the repos.
  - Was able to overcome it by resetting the push and pull urls. 
- Had problems earlier on with making enough time to work on the project due to family responsibilities, 2 other classes, and other things that came up during the semester.
  - Most of the time, was able to carve out at least a couple hours a week to try and make some form of progress
- Was stuck on how to progress and implement the API into our website for a while. Conducted a large amount of research and watched many videos to try and understand where i made a mistake
  - Was able to partially overcome this obstacle by asking professor Toegel and understanding that the way in which i was going about implementing the API was wrong. Then began work on reimplementing the API into the website and adding the necessary changes needed to make the API calls work
- Accidentally lost progress that was made with the API code later in the semester. Accidentally deleted a file that housed most of my updated API files that were not pushed to Github at the time. 

Learnings/experience:
- Learned how to use some other features available to us on github
  - Project board
  - How to create a task list on issues
- Learned how the Amazon EC2 instances work and how to properly set them up
- Project lead experience gained. When it came to figuring out a plan of action for what we wanted to complete and how, I was able to step in and give an outline and distribute the workload so each team member would be able to work on a specific task that is needed for the specific assignment being worked on.
- I also experienced a project killing issue that could potentially occur but is very rare.
  - In our instance, we lost access to our app VM resulting in the loss of the majority of our project progress in terms of the webpage. We did not lose our MQ or DB progress due to the data being on two other VM’s but it was a learning experience. 
  - In this scenario, we were able to experience what would happen if a catastrophic error occurred during project development. I also learned that if we are using a third party service or even working locally, we should always have a backup of our data saved elsewhere in case progress is lost for any unforeseen circumstance. However in our case, we had forgotten to save our progress and had to start from scratch. 
- Learned how to setup RabbitMQ, mysql to create a database, and how to create a properly working webpage through a linux instance. 
  - I've had some experience working with linux and Git to create a website through IT202 but I feel that doing this along with creating an MQ and a DB on linux VMs is more difficult. But I had fun learning how to do it. 
- Learning how to implement an API into our webpage was also quite interesting and was a good learning experience. At first I thought that it was as simple as adding a file with the proper code snippet but then, with a little help, I was able to learn how to convert the json data that is returned from the API call into an array and then display the information onto the webpage with whatever formatting was necessary

Obstacles:  
- I have lost my VM and have to do everything from scratch
- Had issues related to github
  - Git pull, git commit and git push
- Had issue setup DB VM
- Spent a lot of time on reg/ login page to work

Learnings/experience:
- Learned how to use Amazon EC2 instances and how to set it up.
- Get familiar with web designing using PHP
- Get a chance to work as a group and work as a team.
- Get familiar with the PHP language and learn many new things.
- Learned more about github. I had no experience with  github. Now I understand how github is used for projects.
- Learned how rabbitmq works since I had never used it before.
- Learned how to use mysql in the terminal.
- Learned how to manage time when working in a project as a group.
- I had minimal experience in Linux but working on a project helps to understand more linux commands and deep understanding of how linux works.
- Learning API is very interesting in this project.
  - Learn how to convert the json data into an array.

Obstacles:  
- Many of us faced similar issues overall, especially that of the loss of our APP VM towards the final weeks of the project. That really hindered our progress and pretty much had us starting from scratch and rallying together as a team to get what we could done. 
- Another obstacle was during Milestone 2, when we were trying to figure out how exactly to connect to each VM and went ahead with the wrong process using zerotier instead of just going ahead with ‘SSH-ing’ into each VM. This delayed us quite a bit in terms of getting milestone 2 done.  
- Another obstacle I had was my understanding of Github. Took me some time to fully understand how to push data onto Git and keep it organized but as the project progressed, I got a better understanding of it. 
- Another obstacle but learning experience was time management between my other class and working full time as an Exchange/Network Engineer.  
Learnings/experience: 
- This project was an incredible learning experience for me, especially with using Amazon’s services. I never had the opportunity to work with an Amazon EC2 instance before, and I was surprised at how smooth and simple it was to set up and get us started on a massive project like this. 
- Along with learning and experiencing Amazon’s EC2, it was the first time working on a project in a group in this format even through my work experience at Microsoft. I got to experience what building a project like this would be in the real world from scratch, and how to split up the work but still work together.
- I learned several different linux commands and was my first experience using a messenger queue. 
- Although I did not work on the PHP as much as other members of my group, I still gained some knowledge and experience on how to create a front end with the use of PHP. 
- Learned how API’s are used in the real world and are the basis of many platforms and services we use in our daily lives and got to learn how they work.

Obstacles: 
- The main obstacle we faced as a group was when we lost our APP VM in Week 8. This really set us back
- In the third milestone, the only setback we had is that we did not know what exactly we needed to screenshot for the submission portion
- The registration and the login functionalities took more time than expected which set us back in time as well
- Our schedules really differed a lot as well so we could only meet up in the night time after all of us had draining days so our minds were not clear when we were talking and often taking longer to find a solution when it was in front of us most of the time. 
Learnings/experience:
- Amazon’s EC2 was a great experience because I have used Ubuntu in VMware before and at first i thought doing everything through the terminal was skeptical at first because there was no direct visual viewpoint but at the end of the day I was used to it
- Learning more about API’s in general and how to decipher them were a major skill I added because it makes creating new and improved things easier. 
- Learned more about load balancing and why it is important to websites no matter the function of the website
- Learned how to debug in the testing stage and think of different solutions on the spot which is extremely critical in the real world
- Some skills I picked up include : PHP, a little bit of MySQL, Messenger Queries, time management and how to take on a leadership role and what is expected of me.
